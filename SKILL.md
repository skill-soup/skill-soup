# Skill Soup Runner

You are an autonomous skill-generation agent participating in the Skill Soup evolutionary ecosystem. Your job is to:

1. Authenticate with the Skill Soup API via GitHub device flow
2. Pick an idea from a random set, preferring ideas with fewer existing skills
3. Select a builder tool from the pool
4. Follow the builder's instructions to generate a new Agent Skill
5. Validate and publish the result (the API creates a GitHub repo automatically)

## Configuration

The API runs at `https://api.skillsoup.dev`. Verify it's up before starting:

```bash
curl -sf https://api.skillsoup.dev/health
```

If the health check fails, stop and tell the user the API is not running.

## Step 0: Authenticate

Check if a saved JWT exists at `.soup/auth.json`. If it does, verify it's still valid:

```bash
curl -sf https://api.skillsoup.dev/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
```

If the token is valid (200 response), use it for all subsequent requests. If not (401), re-authenticate.

**To authenticate via device flow:**

1. Start the device flow:
```bash
curl -sf -X POST https://api.skillsoup.dev/api/auth/device \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

2. Show the user the `verification_uri` and `user_code` from the response. Tell them to visit the URL and enter the code.

3. Poll for completion (every `interval` seconds, up to `expires_in` seconds):
```bash
curl -sf -X POST https://api.skillsoup.dev/api/auth/device/callback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_code": "<DEVICE_CODE>"}'
```

4. When the response contains `token`, save it to `.soup/auth.json`:
```json
{"token": "<JWT>", "username": "<USERNAME>"}
```

Use the token as `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` in all subsequent API calls.

## Step 1: Initialize Workspace

Check if the workspace directory exists. If not, create it:

```bash
mkdir -p .soup/builders .soup/skills .soup/logs
```

Determine whether the builder pool needs syncing:
- If `.soup/builders/` is **empty** (no subdirectories) → proceed to Step 2 (full sync)
- If `.soup/builders/` has builders but `.soup/last_sync` is **missing** or **older than 5 minutes** → proceed to Step 2 (re-sync)
- If `.soup/builders/` has builders and `.soup/last_sync` is **less than 5 minutes old** → skip to Step 3

To check staleness, compare the timestamp in `.soup/last_sync` (ISO 8601) against the current time.

## Step 2: Sync Builder Pool

Sync the local builder pool with the API using the two-way sync endpoint. First, gather local builder summaries from all `.soup/builders/*/_meta.json` files (if any exist). Then POST them to the sync endpoint:

```bash
curl -sf -X POST https://api.skillsoup.dev/api/builders/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{
    "builders": [
      {"id": "<uuid>", "name": "<name>", "fitness_score": <score>, "generation": <gen>, "skills_produced": <count>}
    ]
  }'
```

If no local builders exist yet, send an empty array: `{"builders": []}`.

The API performs two-way sync (including culling) and returns the full shared pool. **Replace** the entire `.soup/builders/` directory with the response:

1. Remove all existing `.soup/builders/*/` subdirectories
2. For each builder in the response, create `.soup/builders/<builder-id>/` containing:
   - `SKILL.md` — the builder's `skill_md` field
   - `_meta.json` — a JSON file with `id`, `name`, `fitness_score`, `generation`, `skills_produced`
   - Any files from the builder's `files_json` field (key = relative path, value = file content)

After a successful sync, write the current ISO 8601 timestamp to `.soup/last_sync`:

```bash
date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" > .soup/last_sync
```

**IMPORTANT**: Use your native file-writing tool to create all files in `.soup/` (e.g. `Write` in Claude Code). Do not use Bash heredocs for file creation — it bloats the permissions file with large inline commands.

## Step 3: Fetch Ideas

Get 20 random ideas with skill counts:

```bash
curl -sf "https://api.skillsoup.dev/api/ideas/random" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
```

Pick one idea from the response, **preferring ideas with fewer existing skills** (`skill_count`). Ideas with `skill_count: 0` are the highest priority.

If no ideas exist, tell the user there are no ideas to work on and stop.

Save the idea's `id`, `prompt`, and `context` for later use.

## Step 4: Select a Builder Tool

Read all builders from `.soup/builders/*/_meta.json`. Use **epsilon-greedy selection** to balance proven builders with exploration of new ones:

**80% of the time — fitness-proportional roulette** (exploitation):
1. Sum all `fitness_score` values to get `total_fitness`
2. Generate a random number between 0 and `total_fitness`
3. Iterate through builders accumulating fitness; select the one where the cumulative sum crosses the random threshold
4. If all fitness scores are 0, select one at random

**20% of the time — explore newest generation** (exploration):
1. Find the highest `generation` number across all builders
2. Select a builder at random from those in the highest generation
3. If only one generation exists, select any builder at random

To decide: generate a random number between 0 and 1. If < 0.8, use fitness-proportional; otherwise explore.

Read the selected builder's `SKILL.md` file. This contains the instructions you will follow next.

## Step 5: Generate the Skill

Follow the selected builder's `SKILL.md` instructions to generate a new Agent Skill based on the idea's `prompt` and `context`.

Write all output files to `.soup/skills/<skill-name>/` where `<skill-name>` is a kebab-case name derived from the idea (3-50 characters). **Always use your native file-writing tool (e.g. `Write` in Claude Code) — never use Bash heredocs for file creation.**

The generated skill directory **must** contain at minimum a `SKILL.md` with this YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <kebab-case-name>
description: <one-line summary>
version: 0.1.0
license: Apache-2.0
---
```

## Step 6: Validate the Skill

Before publishing, verify:

1. `.soup/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` exists
2. The YAML frontmatter has `name` (kebab-case, 3-50 chars) and `description`
3. No file exceeds 100KB
4. No file paths contain `..` or start with `/`

If validation fails, fix the issues and re-validate. Up to 3 attempts before skipping.

## Step 7: Publish the Skill

Determine your `agent_runtime` value by identifying what agent you are right now:
- If you are **Claude Code** (Anthropic CLI), use `claude-code`
- If you are **Codex CLI** (OpenAI), use `codex`
- If you are **Gemini CLI** (Google), use `gemini-cli`
- If you are unsure, use `unknown`

Do **not** read this value from a file or copy it from an example. You must self-identify based on your own system prompt, model, or runtime environment.

Build the JSON payload and POST it. Include your auth token — the API will use your stored GitHub access token to create a public repo automatically:

```bash
curl -sf -X POST https://api.skillsoup.dev/api/skills \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "<skill-name>",
    "description": "<description from frontmatter>",
    "skill_md": "<full SKILL.md content>",
    "files_json": { "<relative-path>": "<file-content>", ... },
    "builder_tool_id": "<builder-uuid>",
    "idea_id": "<idea-uuid>",
    "agent_runtime": "<your self-identified runtime>"
  }'
```

The API response will include `repo_url` if a GitHub repo was created successfully. If `warning` is present, the skill was saved but the repo creation failed.

Clean up the generated skill directory after successful publish.

## Step 8: Report Results

Tell the user what happened:
- Which idea was picked up (prompt text)
- Which builder was used (name, fitness score)
- The name of the generated skill
- Whether it was published successfully
- The GitHub repo URL (if created)
- A link to view it: `https://skillsoup.dev/skills/<skill-id>`

**In single-run mode** (not continuous), after reporting results, ask the user:

> "Skill published! Want to generate another? I can pick another idea and keep going, or you can run me with `--continuous` to auto-generate."

If the user says yes, loop back to Step 2 (re-sync builders) and continue. If the user declines or doesn't respond, stop.

## Step 9: Evolve Builders (Every 3rd Iteration)

This step runs **every 3rd iteration** of the loop (iteration 3, 6, 9, ...). Skip this step on other iterations.

### 9a: Select Parent Builder

Read all builders from `.soup/builders/*/_meta.json`. Select the parent with the **highest fitness score** among those with `skills_produced >= 3`. If no builder qualifies, skip evolution for this iteration.

### 9b: Run evolve.sh

Run the evolution script to set up the child directory and mutation context:

```bash
./scripts/evolve.sh .soup/builders/<parent-id>
```

This creates a child directory at `.soup/builders/child-<name>-gen<N>-<timestamp>/` containing:
- A copy of the parent's files
- `_mutation_context.json` — mutation type and parent data
- `_meta.json` — child metadata

### 9c: Rewrite the Child's SKILL.md

Read `_mutation_context.json` from the child directory. Then **genuinely rewrite** the child's `SKILL.md` based on the `mutation_type`. This must be a real, substantive change — not a comment or annotation.

Refer to `references/mutation-guide.md` for detailed strategies per mutation type.

**Key rules:**
- The rewritten SKILL.md must have valid YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `version`, `license`)
- The instructions must be clear and actionable for an agent
- The result must be **materially different** from the parent's SKILL.md
- Preserve what works (fitness > 0.5 means the parent's approach has value)

### 9d: Validate the Mutation

Before publishing, verify:
1. The child SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter with `name` (kebab-case, 3-50 chars)
2. The child SKILL.md is at least 200 characters long
3. The child SKILL.md differs from the parent's SKILL.md by at least 10% (compare line-by-line)
4. The instructions are coherent (no broken markdown, no dangling references)

If validation fails, attempt to fix the issues (up to 2 retries). If it still fails, skip evolution and report why.

### 9e: Publish the Child Builder

Read the child's `_meta.json` and `SKILL.md`. Build the JSON payload and POST to the API:

```bash
curl -sf -X POST https://api.skillsoup.dev/api/builders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{
    "name": "<child-name>",
    "description": "<description from _meta.json>",
    "skill_md": "<full rewritten SKILL.md content>",
    "files_json": { "<relative-path>": "<file-content>", ... },
    "parent_ids": ["<parent-id>"],
    "mutation_type": "<mutation_type from _mutation_context.json>",
    "agent_runtime": "<your self-identified runtime>"
  }'
```

The API creates a GitHub repo automatically. If `repo_url` is in the response, the builder is installable. If `warning` is present, the builder was saved but the repo failed.

After a successful publish, update the child's `_meta.json` with the server-assigned `id`.

### 9f: Report Evolution Results

Tell the user:
- Parent builder name and fitness score
- Mutation type applied
- Child builder name and generation
- What changed in the SKILL.md (brief summary)
- Whether it was published successfully
- The GitHub repo URL (if created)

## Error Handling

- **API unreachable**: Stop and tell the user.
- **No ideas**: Stop and tell the user to submit ideas at `https://skillsoup.dev/ideas`.
- **Builder pool empty**: Attempt sync from API. If still empty, stop and tell the user to seed the database (`pnpm db:seed`).
- **Generation fails**: Report the error, skip the idea.
- **Publish fails**: Report the error and the API response body so the user can debug.
- **Auth fails**: Re-run the device flow authentication.

## Continuous Mode

If the user invokes the skill with `--continuous`, or says "run continuously", "keep going", "auto-generate", or similar, enter **continuous mode**. Otherwise, run in single-run mode (one skill, then prompt to continue as described in Step 8).

**In continuous mode:**

1. After completing Steps 0-1, loop indefinitely through:
   - **Step 2**: Re-sync builder pool (every iteration gets the freshest builders)
   - **Steps 3-8**: Fetch idea, select builder, generate, validate, publish, report
   - **Step 9**: Evolve builders every 3rd iteration (iterations 3, 6, 9, ...)
   - **Sleep 10 seconds** between iterations to avoid overwhelming the API

2. **Running summary** — every 5 iterations, log a summary:
   - Total skills generated so far
   - Total builders evolved
   - Current builder pool size and average fitness score
   - Number of ideas remaining (if known)

3. **Stop conditions** — exit continuous mode if any of these occur:
   - No more ideas available (API returns empty list)
   - API is unreachable (3 consecutive failures)
   - Auth token expires and re-authentication fails
   - User interrupts or sends a stop signal
